===================
Chapter 2
===================

This should start a new chapter.

Section Heading
===============

Subsection Heading
------------------

Here comes a warning message in a box:

.. warning:: A warning message in a box.

And some more text before a C++ code block:

.. code-block:: c++

   int var = 1;
   double value = 2.0;

A quick note:

.. note:: This is just a quick note, similar to a remark.

There are also other directives to put text into boxes.

.. deprecated:: 1.2
   Naturally, sometimes stuff gets deprecated.

Refernces to other parts of the documenation are possible as well.

.. seealso:: Related information is also important.

Good job in setting up such a nice documentation generator!
